BUGS
    - how to replicate: press k when the last article is already selected. you get 'Uncaught ReferenceError: allpapers is not defined'
   
TODO
    - first article should already be selected when new file loaded
    - post coding and commenting standards
    - mid-high level architecture
    - make the file uploader better
    - impliment namespaces (https://addyosmani.com/blog/essential-js-namespacing/)
    - impliment proper use of const and var
    - make a coding standards doc
    - The current decision button should be taken from a property of the paper object (ie allpapers[i]['decision']). 
    - Figure out why "data-target": ".collapsingItem" + i is neccessary in the function getNewTableRow
    - finish the jsdoc for all javascript documents
    - Enforce indentation, naming conventions and semicolon standards
    - make file import better: https://www.sitepoint.com/html5-file-drag-and-drop/ or https://blueimp.github.io/jQuery-File-Upload/basic.html
    - figure out how to seperate displayPapers from importFile and analyze paper on server
    - add jsdoc comments to file_importer
    - set up better github pull requests tracking
    - add automatic focusing to currently selected row in table
    - add namespace and jsdoc for component_animater

    


think about
  - where will metadata come from like the user's decision?
