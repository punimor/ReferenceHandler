TODO
    - first article should already be selected when new file loaded
    - post coding and commenting standards
    - mid-high level architecture
    - make the file uploader better
    - impliment namespaces (https://addyosmani.com/blog/essential-js-namespacing/)
    - impliment proper use of const and var
    - make a coding standards doc
