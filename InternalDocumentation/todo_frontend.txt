BUGS
    - if you press k when the last article is already selected. you get 'Uncaught ReferenceError: allpapers is not defined'
   
TODO
    - first article should already be selected when new file loaded
    - impliment namespaces (https://addyosmani.com/blog/essential-js-namespacing/)
    - The current decision button should be taken from a property of the paper object (ie allpapers[i]['decision']). 
    - Figure out why "data-target": ".collapsingItem" + i is neccessary in the function getNewTableRow
    - finish the jsdoc for all remaining javascript documents
    - Enforce indentation, naming conventions, proper use of const and var and semicolon standards for all remaining js
    - clean the searchterms html/js
    - automatic focus to currently selected cell
    - make up/down arrows go through articles
    - automatic scrolling (loading/unloading of papers to the screen when you scroll through)
    - make all js docs adhere to this pattern: http://devnull.absolventa.de/2014/03/25/jsdoc-and-the-revealing-module-pattern/
    - make file upload interface better: https://www.sitepoint.com/html5-file-drag-and-drop/ or https://blueimp.github.io/jQuery-File-Upload/basic.html
    - figure out how to seperate displayPapers from importFile and analyze paper on server
    - add jsdoc comments to file_importer
    - set up better github pull requests tracking
    - add automatic focusing to currently selected row in table
    - add namespace and jsdoc for component_animater
    - add a gitignore to ignore jsdoc and InternalDocumentation
    - rename forlder WEbpages to Frontend and InternalDocumentation to InternalDoc
    - add a cmd+? shortcut to show all shortcuts (similar to gmail)
